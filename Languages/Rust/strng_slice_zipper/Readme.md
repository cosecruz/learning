# Day 2: Lifetime Annotations

Concepts: Explicit lifetimes, multiple lifetime parameters
Build: String slice zipper (interleave two &str by words)
Constraints: Return type must borrow from both inputs
Trap: Lifetime elision hiding complexity
Question: Draw the borrow graph on paper. Where do lifetimes constrain each other?
